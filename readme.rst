Notes
*******************

-- I tried to use codeigniter -- This first project of mine in codeigniter and I took 5-6 hrs to create this as time was limited (one day).

-- I used full MVC structure, used model for database operations

-- I used codeigniter's default functionality mostly, but please allow me where it can't be possible at this moment

-- I didn't used anywhere raw query like "SELECT * from ...." instead I used codeigniter's query builder

-- I used template functionality, created header and footer

-- tried to make it responsive as much as I can.

-- Using bootsrap we can make it responsive easily and visually attractive (not used in this project at this moment, as per the rules of sheet provided).

-- Please consider the code quality and standards for neat code.
